You need to have the HLS playback plugin in project, i added demos in the Lightshaft/Players/ folder, you need to import the desired player to the project.


If you receive errors related to MediaPlayerCtrl not found, remeber that you need the easy movie texture asset:

(Easy movie texture hls playback is not working good in desktop, but works great in mobile builds, avpro are working for all platforms).

For AvPro you can get the trial package here:

For UMP request me in my email if you dont know how to edit the avpro code to add for your own.

Unity have plans to add HLS support so, in the future you will dont need that plugins(i hope so), but by now, is the only way to play livestreams in your project.
I'll create a major version with all youtube features integrated then if you want to upgrade you will be able to pay only the difference.
